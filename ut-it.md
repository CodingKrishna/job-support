# UT VS IT
| Unit Test  | Integration Test |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| independent classes or functions are tested to check functionality in the application code. | Integration testing is to test functionality in interaction between multiple logical/functional units |
| There is no layer testing  | We need to perform real operations to check all the layers are working well in the flow. Here, the layers are controller, service, repositoryâ€¦  |
| We need to perform mocking operations. Not real ones!  | We need not to dependent on mocks We can perform operations on real software with mocked endpoints. |
| NO E2E(end to end testing) | We can perform e2e testing |


### Recommendation: 
We can use integration testing for api's(get all, get by id, save, update) e2e testing and UT for specific logic's (some business logic) in the application which is not covered as part of integration e2e tests.
